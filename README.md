# Shadowpage for Mahdollisuuksien maisemia- event.


## Project Description

This is a project for our course "Media Distribution and Data Streams". 
Goal was to build a shadowpage with live streaming ability for an event and deploy and host it on Azure environment. Working and sensible UI/UX design was also a requirement.

### Team's comment
>  This shadowpage is fully responsive and thoroughly thought to be accessible. We also used a lot of time to focus on visual look and make the page match the event.


## Built With

- Tailwind
- Video.js
- Socket.io
